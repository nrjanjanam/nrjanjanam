👋 Hi, I’m **Neeha Rathna Janjanam.** You can call me Neeha! 
<br><br>
🧑‍🎓 I am a Master's Student at New York University, majoring in Computer Science.
👀 I’m passionate about **research and creating models in Deep learning and Machine learning**. I am very intrigued about **Data Analysis and Data Visualization** too. I am also interested in sharing my experiences in form of blog articles. You can check them on [OpenGenus](https://iq.opengenus.org/author/neehoney/)
<br><br>
🌱 I’m always reading and learning new trends in AI everyday! Especially about LLMs since their advent. Currently, I am trying to create an LLM from scratch following the tutorial by Andrej Kaparthy!
